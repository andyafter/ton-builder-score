## Conclusion

The TON Builder Score will be a critical piece of infrastructure to accelerate the growth of the web3 projects built on TON and those who want to onboard TON. The key value of TON Builder Score would be:

1. Creating a standard for user activity and reputation measurement on TON. Enabling users to digitalize their impact.
2. Helping projects to airdrop to a user crowd that has the highest potential of boosting their growth efficiently.
3. Advocate competition among community participants, improve overall performance of web3 projects.
4. Enable users to monetize their impact on TON.

In the initial phase of Tbook, we need to work with the top applications on TON network as the cold start phase. Thus we need help from TON to connect us with these applications.
With the integration of TON Builder Score in Tbook Incentive Passport, we will be able to help projects built on TON to gain their advantages on the market quickly. We will also be able to bring more high quality community builders and web3 projects into the TON ecosystem.
